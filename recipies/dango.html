        <li>3 tsp of baking powder</li>
        <li>1 cup of sugar</li>

        <li>4 tsp of vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start by combining the carbonated water, evaporated milk, and vanilla extract in a bottle and shaking lightly to mix. This will make more than needed for one recipe, so make more or throw the rest away. </p>

    <p>Combine the rest of the ingredients in a separate bowl. Then slowly add it into the eggs, folding it in with a rubber spatula. DO NOT OVERMIX!</p>
    <p>Drop into hot oil with a scooper, and wait until they are golden brown (test the center with a chopstick)</p>
